Sorting

Collection sorting techniques

This is a small VB6 project I created to help a demonstration on how different sorting algorithms worked (Bubble sort, quick sort, gnome sort etc). I didn't write the algorithm for the different sorts listed but I added a visual graph to show the elements as they were being sorted.

Project also includes timers to show the effeciency of each sort and a short description of each sort.
